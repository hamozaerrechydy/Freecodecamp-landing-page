            <h2>A student review: </h2>
            <blockquote>
                I am a student at freeCodeCamp, I wanted to learn to code and get a job as a developer, there is a lot of courses online to learn programming but I signed up to freeCodeCamp because of many reasons: the first and biggest reason is that freeCodeCamp is an in depth course, you start out as a begineer and you end up on an intermidiate level. Practicing is the secret of a good developer and freeCodeCamp is all about that, the whole curriculum is practice: challanges, projects and problems, you will write a lot of code. It makes you job ready, it teaches you actual real world technlogies professional developers uses to create stuff so you will gain the experience and skills companies looking for. In the world of programming there's a lot of technlogies and languages, freeCodeCamp teaches you web development technlogies, and for languages they picked up JavaScript and Python, and those choices are great for those who want to get hired, because this where the demand is. Also there's a huge community to support you, you can ask questions, be active with the founders and learners on social media (Quincy is a great founder he will give you time and empathy to support and help if you reach out to him on twitter or somewhere else, thanks man), so the community is very supportive. All of this is free so freeCodeCamp worth the time.
